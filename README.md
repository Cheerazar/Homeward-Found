### What is Homeward Found?
Homeward Found is a web app built for helping users find lost pets.  A user will be able to create a listing for a lost pet or a pet they found and have the application return potential matches.  They would then be able to contact someone who has found their pet.

### User stories (core)
* A user can reach the application and see a map of lost pets, sighted pets, and sighted pets that have been picked up
* A user can create an account and log in
* A user can create a listing for a lost pet
* A user can create a listing for a pet sighting
* A user can create a listing for a pet they've picked up

### Considered Technical Features/Goals
* Lightweight Ruby on Rails backend with a search matching algorithm that returns a JSON response
* Heavy Client-side processing in Javascript with the REACT library and a possible Backbone framework
* One page responsive application with dynamic forms and user interactions
* Geolocation via HTML 5
* Google Maps API integration to handle mapping
